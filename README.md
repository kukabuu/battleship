# Battleship

It's a simple version of the game with one player. 

### How does the program work?

- A game board creates and the battleships add to the board. 
- A player clicks on the button "Start game" and makes an "attack" on the field. The program reports back whether the attack resulted in a hit, a miss or a sinking. 
- A player may start a new game at any moment. All it needs is to click to the button "Finish game" and after that "Start new game".
- Hit statistics are displayed at the end of the game.
